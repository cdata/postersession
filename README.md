PosterSession
=============
I needed to whip up a quick presentation, and I thought to myself, "There is
probably a library out there that will help me do this with very basic HTML."

There is no library (that I could find in ten minutes of searching) which will
let me do this with very basic HTML.

PosterSession let's you make a presentation using very basic HTML.

Step one
--------
Create an HTML5 page with an ordered list as the only child of the body.

Step two
--------
Populate each list item as though each one represents a slide.

Step three
----------
Drop in PosterSession's JS and CSS files.

Voila!
